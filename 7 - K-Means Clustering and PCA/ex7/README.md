# K-Means Clustering and PCA: project overview

In the first part of this project, the K-means clustering algorithm will be implemented and applied to compress an image. 
In the second part, principal component analysis is used to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.

Major steps taken:

- 1 K-means Clustering
- 1.1 Implementing K-means
- 1.2 K-means on example dataset
- 1.3 Random initialization
- 1.4 Image compression with K-means
- 2 Principal Component Analysis
- 2.2 Implementing PCA
- 2.3 Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
- 2.4 Face Image Dataset
