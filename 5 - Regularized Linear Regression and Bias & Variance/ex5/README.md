# Regularized Linear Regression and Bias & Variance: project overview

In this project regularized linear regression has been implemented and used to study models with different bias-variance properties.

Major steps taken:

- 1 Regularized Linear Regression
- 1.1 Visualizing the dataset
- 1.2 Regularized linear regression cost function
- 1.3 Regularized linear regression gradient
- 1.4 Fitting linear regression
- 2 Bias-variance
- 2.1 Learning curves
- 3 Polynomial regression
- 3.1 Learning Polynomial Regression
