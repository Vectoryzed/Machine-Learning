# Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems: project overview

In first part of this project, the anomaly detection algorithm has been implemented and applied to detect failing servers on a network. 
In the second part, the collaborative filtering has been used to build a recommender system  for movies.

Main steps taken:

1) Anomaly detection
1.1) Gaussian distribution
1.2) Estimating parameters for a Gaussian
1.3) Selecting the threshold
1.4) High dimensional dataset
2) Recommender Systems
2.1) Movie ratings dataset
2.2) Collaborative filtering learning algorithm
2.3) Learning movie recommendations
