In this project logistic regression has been implemented on MATLAB and how it applies to two different datasets has been showed.

Major steps taken:

- 1 Logistic Regression
- 1.1 Visualizing the data
- 1.2 Implementation
- 2 Regularized logistic regression
- 2.1 Visualizing the data
- 2.2 Feature mapping
- 2.3 Cost function and gradient
- 2.4 Plotting the decision boundary
